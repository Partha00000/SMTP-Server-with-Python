This project implements a simple SMTP server using Python. The server listens for incoming email messages on a specified port and processes them. Itâ€™s designed to be an educational project for understanding the basics of SMTP protocols and asynchronous programming using Python. It also uses aiosmtpd to handle SMTP communication.

Features:
Listens for incoming SMTP connections on a specified port (default is 1025).
Processes incoming emails.
Lightweight and easy-to-understand implementation for educational purposes.
Requirements:
To run the SMTP server locally, you'll need the following:

Python 3.7+
aiosmtpd library (for handling SMTP protocol)
A virtual environment (optional, but recommended)
